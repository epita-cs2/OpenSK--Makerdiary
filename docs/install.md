# Installation guide

This document describes in details how to turn a Makerdiary nRF52840 MDK board into a
working FIDO2 security key.

## Pre-requisite

### Hardware

You will need the following supported board:

*   [Makerdiary nRF52840-MDK USB dongle](https://makerdiary.com/blogs/news/getting-started-with-google-opensk).


### Software

In order to compile and flash a working OpenSK firmware, you will need the
following:

*   [Ubuntu latest version](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?version=20.04.2.0&architecture=amd64#download) (Could be installed on VMware Workstation)
*   Install git (can be installed by sudo apt install git)
*   rustup (can be installed with [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
*   python3 and pip (can be installed with the `python3-pip` package on Debian)
*   The OpenSSL command line tool (can be installed with the `libssl-dev`
    package on Debian)
*   [nrfutil](https://pypi.org/project/nrfutil/) (can be installed by `sudo pip3 install nrfutil` or `sudo pip3 install nrfutil --user` )

2.  Installing Rust 
```shell
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh 
info: downloading installer
Welcome to Rust!
This will download and install the official compiler for the Rust
programming language, and its package manager, Cargo.
Rustup metadata and toolchains will be installed into the Rustup
home directory, located at:
/home/epitacs2/.rustup
This can be modified with the RUSTUP_HOME environment variable.
The Cargo home directory located at:
/home/epitacs2/.cargo
This can be modified with the CARGO_HOME environment variable.
The cargo, rustc, rustup and other commands will be added to
Cargo's bin directory, located at:
/home/epitacs2/.cargo/bin
This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:
/home/epitacs2/. profile
/home/epitacs2/.bashrc
You can uninstall at any time with rustup self uninstall and
these changes will be reverted.
Current installation options:
default host triple: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
default toolchain: stable (default)
profile: default
modify PATH variable: yes
1) Proceed with installation (default)
2) Customize installation
3) Cancel installation
>1

info: profile set to 'default'
info: default host triple is x86_64 - unknown-linux-gnu
warning: Updating existing toolchain, profile choice will be ignored
info: syncing channel updates for 'stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'
info: default toolchain set to 'stable-x86_64 - unknown-linux-gnu'
stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu unchanged - rustc 1.53.0 (53cb7b09b 2021-06-17)
Rust is installed now. Great!
To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).
To configure your current shell, run:
source $HOME/.cargo/env
$ source $HOME/ .cargo/env
```
3.  Access OpenSK directory
```shell
$ cd OpenSK
```
4.  Running the setup script
```shell
$./setup.sh

The setup.sh script performs the following steps:

1.  Make sure that the git submodules are checked out

2.  Apply our patches that haven't yet been merged upstream to both
    [Tock](https://github.com/tock/tock) and
    [libtock-rs](https://github.com/tock/libtock-rs)

3.  Generate a self-signed certificate authority as well as a private key and a
    corresponding certificate for your OpenSK key signed by this CA. You will be
    able to replace them with your own certificate and private key.

4.  Ensure that your Rust toolchain is using the same version that we tested
    OpenSK with.

5.  Install [tockloader](https://github.com/tock/tockloader).

6.  Ensure that the Rust toolchain can compile code for ARM devices.

### Replacing the certificates

All the generated certificates and private keys are stored in the directory
`crypto_data/`.

This is the expected content after running our `setup.sh` script:

File              | Purpose
----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------
`aaguid.txt`      | Text file containaing the AAGUID value
`opensk_ca.csr`   | Certificate sign request for the Root CA
`opensk_ca.key`   | ECC secp256r1 private key used for the Root CA
`opensk_ca.pem`   | PEM encoded certificate of the Root CA
`opensk_ca.srl`   | File generated by OpenSSL
`opensk_cert.csr` | Certificate sign request for the attestation certificate
`opensk_cert.pem` | PEM encoded certificate used for the authenticator
`opensk.key`      | ECC secp256r1 private key used for the autenticator

If you want to use your own attestation certificate and private key, simply
replace `opensk_cert.pem` and `opensk.key` files.

Our build script `build.rs` is responsible for converting the `aaguid.txt` file
into raw data that is then used by the Rust file `src/ctap/key_material.rs`.

Our configuration script `tools/configure.py` is responsible for configuring
an OpenSK device with the correct certificate and private key.



### Flashing a firmware

#### Makerdiary nRF52840-MDK board

1.  Run our script for compiling/flashing Tock OS and OpenSK on your device
    (_output may differ_):
    
    During this deployment you don't have to enter to DFU (Bootloader)
    ```shell
    $ ./deploy.py --board=nrf52840_mdk_dfu --opensk --programmer=none
    info: Updating rust toolchain to nightly-2020-06-10

    ```



### Custom installation

For more options, we invite you to read the help of our `deploy.py` script by
running `./deploy.py --help`.

### Installing the udev rule (Linux only)

By default on Linux, a USB device will require root privilege in order interact
with it. As it is not recommended to run your web browser with such a high
privileged account, we made a `udev` rule file to allow regular users to
interact with OpenSK authenticators.

To install it, you need to execute the following commands:

```shell
sudo cp rules.d/55-opensk.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload
```

Then, you will need to unplug and replug the key for the rule to trigger.

## Convert IntelHex file to UF2
Makerdiary has a UF2 bootloader. By a simple copy of the image file, the USB will be flashed. 

```shell
$ python3 uf2conv.py '/[path of OpenSK-Makerdiary]/target/nrf52840_mdk_dfu_merged.hex' -C -f OxADA52840
Converting to uf2, output size: 780288, start address: 0x1000
Wrote 780288 bytes to flash.uf2.
$ ls
flash.uf2 mergehex uf2conv.py
```
### Create a directory
You have to be root in order to execute the below command. 
```shell
$ mkdir /mnt/mass_storage
```

### Access bootloader
Press and hold the button for 5 seconds, while plugged in. 

### Check your USB partition name

```shell
$ dmesg
```
or 

```shell
$ lsusb
```

### Mounting the USB to a directory
You have to be root in order to execute the below command.
To know your usb partition name, you have to execute the command.

```shell
$ mount -t vfat /dev/sdb /mnt/mass_storage/
```

### Installing the firmware
You have to be root to execute the below commands.
```shell
$ cp [path of the IntelHex image file]/[name of image].uf2 /mnt/mass_storage/
```
```shell
$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 008: ID 1915:521f Nordic Semiconductor ASA VMware Virtual USB Mouse
Bus 002 Device 003: ID Deof:0002 VMware, Inc. Virtual USB Hub
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 0eof:0003 VMware, Inc. Virtual Mouse
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub
```

## Successfull installation

The name of the product changes from Makerdiary to OpenSK
```shell
$ dmesg 
[ 3313.424703] usb 2-2.1: Product: OpenSK
```
## Troubleshooting

To test whether the installation was successful, visit a
[demo website](https://webauthn.io/), [demo website 2](https://webauthn.me/)  and try to register and login.


### Linux

If you have issues with the demo website, the following commands should help you
understand whether OpenSK was installed properly.

When plugging in the USB key, the following line should appear in `lsusb`.

```shell
$ lsusb
...
Bus XXX Device YYY: ID 1915:521f Nordic Semiconductor ASA OpenSK
```

You should also see lines similar to the following in `dmesg`.

```shell
$ dmesg
...
[XXX] usb A-BB: new full-speed USB device number 00 using xhci_hcd
[XXX] usb A-BB: New USB device found, idVendor=1915, idProduct=521f, bcdDevice= 0.01
[XXX] usb A-BB: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
[XXX] usb A-BB: Product: OpenSK
[XXX] usb A-BB: Manufacturer: Nordic Semiconductor ASA
[XXX] usb A-BB: SerialNumber: v0.1
[XXX] hid-generic 0000:0000:0000.0000: hiddev0,hidraw0: USB HID v1.10 Device [Nordic Semiconductor ASA OpenSK] on usb-0000:00:00.0-00/input0
```

When plugging in the USB key in bootloader mode (DFU mode), the following line should appear in `lsusb`.
This indicates that the USB is UF2 bootloader, otherwise would be open DFU. 

```shell
$ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 006: ID 239a: 0029 Adafruit nRF52840 MDK USB Dongle
```
